** Use
Note that a present, while the library places appropriate style classes on elements, it doesn't provide style rules for those classes, so it is left up to the user. Styles are set up in accordance with [[https://bulma.io/documentation/elements/table/][bulma]], but are pretty generic. 

The basic usecase is =(retabled.core/table controls table-data)=. Table-data is simply a sequence of uniform maps, the kind of thing you get from a database. Controls defines how to make each row of that data into a table row. 

Full example is in our test, [[https://github.com/BYU-ODH/retabled/blob/master/test/cljs/retabled/core_front.cljs][retabled.core-front]]

*** Programatically set/change filters
From [[https://github.com/BYU-ODH/retabled/blob/master/test/cljs/retabled/core_front.cljs][retabled.core-front]]:
#+begin_src clojure
  ;; Because the second table columns has its `:valfn` as `my-valfn`, 
  ;; `retabled.core-front/myvalfn` is the address for the filter. 
  ;; The filter can programaticaly be changed like so:
  (swap! retabled.core/FILTER-MAP assoc retabled.core-front/my-valfn "2")
#+end_src

*** Removing paging
By default only up to ten results will be shown at a time on a table, with paging provided to get to next results. This can be changed by setting ={:paging nil}= in the control map (as well as other available paging options). 
*** What retabled offers
In addition to other popular libraries, the retabled library allows the ability to page entries, sort entries by column, and filter entries by column. Unique to the retabled library, custom sort and paging functions can be used instead of the default. Additionally, filtering (a.k.a. searching) is optionally case insensitive.

** CHANGES
*** V14
Separate namespaces for sorting and filtering
*** V13
Optional case sensitivity with =ignore-case?=
*** V12
Can programmatically change the filter buttons on a table
*** V8
Sorting now works with multiple tables on the same page (a closure was used instead of global var). 
*** V7
- Removed "#" linking for sorting; now using html5 absent hrefs. 
*** V6
- improved example, nil paging
*** V5
- sortfn bug fixes, sort direction indicated on sort style
*** V4
- sortfn key added to controls
*** V3
- BREAKING: =:cols= renamed to =:columns= in the control-map
- Final screen is now available if there are a remainder of entires
- the colspans of the paging bar are now calculated dynamically

*** V2
- No longer breaks if number of entries is less than screen size

None. Just use this library. It will work better from the box with Bulma styles, though.
